## ü§ó What is This Survey About?
This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the principles, applications, and challenges faced by NLP techniques in SDoH. We address the following specific questions: 
1.  What are the various Natural Language Processing (NLP)-based techniques or models that exist in literature for the detection, identification, extraction, or classification of social determinants of health (SDoH)?  What are the effectiveness and accuracy of such techniques/models?

This survey aims to provide insights into the opportunities and challenges of NLP/LLMs in SDoH, and serve as a practical resource for constructing effective SDoH NLP/LLMs.

## üìö Studies
THE LIST IS CURRENTLY IN-PROGRESS, PLEASE CHECK BACK LATER.
